# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Application Purpose

The goal of this application is to track golf statistics to help golfers improve their game. The app provides insights into performance trends, handicap tracking, and historical round data to identify areas for improvement in a golfer's performance.

## Development Commands

### Primary Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload (Vite)
- `npm run build` - Build production bundle
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

### Common Development Workflow
1. `npm run dev` to start development
2. `npm run lint` to check for issues before committing
3. `npm run build` to verify production build works

## Project Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 19.1.1 with modern hooks (useState)
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.1.2 with @vitejs/plugin-react
- **Linting**: ESLint 9.33.0 with React-specific rules
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with custom properties and grid layouts

### Application Structure
This is a single-page golf tracking application with the following key components:

**Core State Management**:
- `rounds`: Array of golf round objects stored in React state
- `currentRound`: Form state for adding new rounds
- No external state management (Redux, Context, etc.) - uses local React state

**Enhanced Data Model**:

## Development Notes

### Data Persistence
Currently uses in-memory state only - rounds are lost on page refresh. Consider adding localStorage or database integration for production use.

### Statistics and Analytics
The application now tracks comprehensive golf performance data including:
- **Scoring**: Total score, par differential, best rounds
- **Driving**: Fairways hit percentage, average driving distance
- **Approach Play**: Greens in regulation percentage
- **Short Game**: Putting averages, chip shots, bunker play
- **Course Management**: Penalty strokes, course conditions impact
- **Environmental Factors**: Weather, temperature, wind, course conditions

### Handicap Calculation
The current handicap calculation is simplified (average differential √ó 0.96). Official USGA handicap calculation requires course ratings, slope ratings, and more complex algorithms.

### AI Recommendations Engine
The smart recommendations system analyzes golf performance data to provide personalized insights:

**Analysis Categories**:
- **Short Game**: Putting performance analysis with specific improvement targets
- **Driving**: Fairway accuracy assessment and distance vs accuracy optimization
- **Iron Play**: Greens in regulation analysis and approach shot recommendations
- **Course Management**: Penalty stroke reduction and smart play strategies
- **Weather Adaptation**: Performance correlation with weather conditions
- **Performance Trends**: Score trending analysis and momentum recognition
- **Course Difficulty Analysis**: Performance correlation with slope ratings and course difficulty
- **Tee Selection Optimization**: Recommends optimal tee selection based on performance data
- **Course Familiarity Impact**: Analyzes performance differences between familiar and new courses
- **Hole-by-Hole Analysis**: Identifies trouble holes and front 9 vs back 9 performance patterns
- **Round Consistency**: Tracks scoring patterns within individual rounds
- **Round Type Optimization**: Analyzes performance differences between 9-hole and 18-hole rounds
- **Format-Specific Recommendations**: Suggestions based on preferred round length and performance patterns

**Recommendation Types**:
- **Practice Focus Areas**: Specific skills to work on based on statistical weaknesses
- **Action Items**: Concrete steps to improve performance (e.g., "Practice 3-foot putts until 95% success rate")
- **Strategic Advice**: Course management tips based on individual performance patterns
- **Equipment Suggestions**: Recommendations based on distance and accuracy data
- **Mental Game**: Psychological insights from performance trends

**Priority System**: 
- üî¥ **High Priority**: Major weaknesses that significantly impact scoring
- üü° **Medium Priority**: Areas with moderate improvement potential
- üü¢ **Low Priority**: Strengths to maintain or minor optimizations

### Course Integration System
The application includes a sophisticated course management system:

**Course Database**:
- **Local Database**: Pre-loaded with popular courses (Pebble Beach, Augusta National, St. Andrews, etc.)

### Security Configuration
**Environment Variables**:
- API keys are stored in `.env` file (never committed to git)
- `.env` is added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure
- `.env.example` provided as template for setup
- Application gracefully handles missing API keys

**Setup Instructions**:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your GolfCourseAPI.com API key to `.env`
3. Never commit the `.env` file to version control
4. API key format: `VITE_GOLF_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### Testing
No test framework is currently configured. Consider adding Vitest for unit testing React components.
